// More on flow of control.

// As well as selecting a branch of execution based on an expression, we might want
// to repeat an activity while a condition is true. Enter the _while_ loop

// while (boolean expression) statement


let count = 1;

while (count <= 10) {
  console.log('Counting - ' + count);
  count = count + 1;
}

// As before, the <statement> part of the while statement can be anything
// - a single statement
// - a block
// - the empty statement or block

// Write a while loop here to count down from 10 to 1, writing the output
// to the console





// ===================

// You'll sometimes see in code something like the following:

// while (true) {
//   ... a whole bunch of statements...
// }
//

// What does this do? How will this program ever end?
